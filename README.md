<h1><body bgcolor="red" <Today and tommorow></h1>
<p>As I've noticed in this country,many of us were suffering because of this pandemic.
The numbers of crimes are also increasing,and aside from that corruption is happening right now.
People used to save their own selves first without thinking that they are already stepping someone.
Instead of helping each other,Filipinos tend to blame others.We do not unite,instead we do have our own business which isn't right.
How can we conquer these problems if we don't unite?Government Officials prioritized first their wants,their selfishness and most especially their desires.
If you don't have money,you can't afford justice.If these things would continue,Philippines won't be a better country and us,Filipinos would suffer too</P>
